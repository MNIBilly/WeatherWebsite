Hello everyone, welcome to my github repository for the Weather Website.

In order to start the website you need to follow these steps.

Download the entire project.

Go to a command prompt or windows powershell (you need to run them as administrator).

Type these commands one at a time:
 - cd C:\Windows\System32\WeatherProject
 - npm install
 - npm run build
 - npm run dev
   
To the right of "Local:" you should find the link with its port, copy it and paste it into your browser.
